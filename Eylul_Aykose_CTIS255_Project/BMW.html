                them. So BMW shifted its focus to railway brakes and built-in motors. This was so successful that the Berlin-based brakes company Knorr-Bremse AG took majority ownership of BMW in 1920, integrated the company and relocated to Munich. Bayerische
                Motoren Werke GmbH as an independent company disappeared temporarily from the scene – albeit not for long.</td>

                employees, production facilities and company logo, and transferred everything to BFW, Bayerische Flugzeugwerke AG.
                <br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp; In the same year, the company moved into BFW’s factory buildings in Lerchenauer Strasse and changed its name to Bayerische Motoren Werke AG. And that’s how the BMW name found its way into the commercial register for
                a second time.</td>

                else the aircraft manufacturers bequeathed to BMW AG, too: BFW’s founding date of March 7, 1916 is considered to be BMW’s official birthday.</td>

                being refounded as BMW AG in 1922. It was the successor of Bayerische Flugzeugwerke AG, founded in 1916. 1916 is therefore considered BMW’s founding year.
